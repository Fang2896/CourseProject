The system prompt that initiates my responses might be a simple greeting, a question, or any statement that a user inputs, to which I am designed to respond appropriately.\n\nMy prompts and responses are generated based on the text input I receive. I do not have a specific \"system prompt\" that I use to start a conversation\u2014instead, I react to the prompts given to me by users.\n\nFor example, if you ask me a question about science, history, technology, or any other subject, my prompt is your question, and my response is generated based on the information I've been trained on up until my last training data, which includes a diverse range of sources to ensure I can provide informative and relevant answers.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need help with something, feel free to prompt me with your request!"
